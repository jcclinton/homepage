	Welcome to Jamie Clinton's home page!

	In real life I'm just a guy who likes to build stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You can see all my code on <a href="https://github.com/jcclinton">github</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I recently built a Military History app for the iPad. You can see it here: <a href="http://booksadvanced.com/">Books Advanced</a>
</p>
<!--p>
	You can see all my code on <a href="https://github.com/jcclinton">github</a>. Here are some of the projects I have there:
</p>

<p>
	<strong><a href="https://github.com/jcclinton/ness">ness</a></strong> is a project I was using it to get Node to scale between multiple processes, all the while keeping the event interface functioning between persistent objects as if they were all in one process.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><a href="https://github.com/jcclinton/raider">raider</a></strong> is a networking server written in coffeescript. I was using as a real-time multiplayer server for browser-based games. That alone is fairly trivial in Node, the neat part about raider is that it supports independent instancing (with the neat fact that each instance is a closure). 
</p>

<p>
	Other than the Node stuff, I like to program games in my spare time
	<br/>
	I entered Ludum Dare 21, you can view my submission <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5259">here</a> and you can play the game <a href="/escape">here</a>
<br/>
(You can also see what I wanted to eventually do with it <a href="builder/">here</a>)
